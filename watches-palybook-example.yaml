# For this to work, we would need to copy playbook.yaml into the container image.
# # You would accomplish this by modifying the Operator Dockerfile to COPY 'playbook.yaml' into the container as shown below:
# # Dockerfile at <project-name>/build/Dockerfile
# FROM quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator
# COPY roles/ ${HOME}/roles
# COPY watches.yaml ${HOME}/watches.yaml
# # New 'COPY' build step for playbook.yaml
# COPY playbook.yaml ${HOME}/playbook.yaml
  playbook: /root/ocpstest/deploy/CronJobSanity.yaml
